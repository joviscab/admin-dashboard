# Odin Project - Admin Dashboard

## Who am I? What is this?

Hello, my name is Joviscab and this is part of my learning to code journey!

This project is called Admin Dashboard and is part of the Intermediate HTML and CSS Course of The Odin Project. The idea of this project is to put to practice all the CSS Grid knowledge that I have acquired until now. In this project I am going to build an Admin Dashboard, following the instructions of Odin's lesson! The Admin Dashboard will consist in a single page made with CSS Grid.

## Skills

With this project my idea is to check the CSS Grid skills that I have learned until now, as well as using it as an exercise to remember all the lessons until this point.
